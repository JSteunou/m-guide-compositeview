# Marionette CompositeView demo

Started because of a question from a user on [marionettejs gitter channel](https://gitter.im/marionettejs/backbone.marionette). Fixed one thing on jsfiddle with him, but noticed a lot of missusage of Marionette & Backbone.

So I hope this example will help a lot of people to understand CompositeView working as a tree / leaf helper but also app, rootView, regions, ...
