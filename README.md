# Marionette CompositeView demo

Started with a question from a user on marionettejs gitter channel. Fix one thing on jsfiddle with him, but notice a lot of miss usage of Marionette & Backbone.

So I hope this example will help a lot of people to understand CompositeView working as a tree / leaf helper.
